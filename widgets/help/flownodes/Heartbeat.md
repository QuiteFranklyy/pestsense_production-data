## About

The Heartbeat node monitors the output of a channel, making sure that data is being sent or received. After a configurable amount of time passes, if the heartbeat node has not received any data from the channel it is monitoring, it will fire an event.

#### Tips
>The Heartbeat flow node employs the use of a system timer to calculate the time since the node last received a mesage from the previous node. This introduces limitiations in the operation of the flow node. For example:

>If the server goes down during the period when the timer is active, the timer will not be started again until it receives a new message.
