## About
Barcode Scanner widget shows multiple data sources where each segment represents a percentage of the total of all values. It is recommended to use only server events, but client events can be implemented. It requires server events to be set up for client events to work, and the name that is displayed on the barcodescanner is set by changing the name of the server event. An example at the bottom of the page steps through how to do this.
