# Sensahub Widgets

---

## About
+ Widgets are UI elements used to build sophisticated IoT applications that are contextually relevant for the business application use-case.​

+ Widgets can be freely placed on the screen, scaled and configured to accept incoming events from the server, from other widgets, as well as user inputs such as device actuation and forms. ​

---

### Display Data
+ Use the channel and event paradigm to represent data in real time or as historical summaries.

### User Interaction
+ Interact with widgets for user control of systems connected to Sensahub.

### Extensibility
+ Widget behaviors are exposed through events that allow widgets to interact with each other to extend application functionality.​

+ Rich and integrated scripting with the scripting widget enables limitless possibilities.​

+ Widgets can be modified or created and easily added to your application.​

### Forms and Workflows
+ Do more than just basic status display. Use form elements for user input to enabling control and integration of user data alongside IoT data.​

+ Scripting and events allows orchestration of application workflows.
