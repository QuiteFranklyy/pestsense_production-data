#### If this is your first time using Sensahub, it is recommended that you read through the **Beginners Guide** in the Sensahub Concepts folder first. This guide will walk you through how to navigate Sensahub, and how to use the Design and Flows screens.

<br>

#### After you have read through the **Beginners Guide**, you are ready to complete the **Walkthrough Examples**.

<br>

 >Find detailed information for each **Widget** or **Flownode**, including how it works, what **Events** it can use, and how to configure widget-specific settings.
